<h1>Toon Data Visualization Project</h1>
<h3>Our Friend Nodebox</h3>
<h3>Descriptions, Requirements and limitations</h3>
<p>Nodebox is a programmatic tool which uses Python to create 2D visuals.  Although the program does have some interactive capability other programs would be far more useful in this matter.  Also Nodebox has not been supported in some time, as it has been replaced by Nodebox 3.  The Video below goes into greater detail about both Nodebox and code behind my project.</p>

<h3>Examples of Journalistic Use</h3>
<p>As discussed before Nodebox is not a great data visualization tool, however with outside the box thinking it can be.  Such as this Lunar Calendar and Sun Dial.</p>
