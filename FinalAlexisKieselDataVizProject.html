	<h1><font face="Cursive" color="green">Alexis' Data Visualization Project: Leaflet</font></h1>
	<p><font face="verdana">Leaflet is the leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.
	 Leaflet can be used in many ways. You have most likely seen Leaflet used without even realizing it.
	 It is widely used, especially in building web mapping applications. This tool is useful especially in making interactive maps.
	 It has all the mapping features and tools that most developers might need. 
	 It has many plugins. First being released in 2011, Leaflet is supported by most mobile and desktop platforms and can be used with HTML5 and CSS3.
	 It is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries along with OpenLayers and the Google Maps API.
	 It can be seen in use by major websites such as Pinterest, Flickr and FourSquare.
	 Leaflet allows developers who lack a GIS background to make tiled web maps hosted on a public server with ease.
	 GeoJSON files, which is what I used along with my html document, can be loaded into leaflet and can create and style interactive layers.
	 The tool was developed by Vladimir Agafonkin.

	<h2><font face="Cursive">Where to get Leaflet</font></h1>
	<p><font face="verdana">Leaflet can be downloaded online from <a href="http://leafletjs.com/download.html">http://leafletjs.com/download.html</a>.</font></p>

	</div>
	<p><font face="verdana">A hosted version of Leaflet can also be used. To use it, the following code can be placed in the head of the HTML code.</font></p>

	<h2><font face="Cursive">What is needed to make Leaflet work</font></h1>
	<p><font face="verdana">In order to make Leaflet work, one needs an html document and a JavaScript document. 
	One must also download Leaflet from the website provided above. 
	Full source codes can also be downloaded at GitHub. 
	The documents for html and JavaScript can be done on TextWrangler or another text editor, and the other downloads can be found on the Leaflet website at the URL above.</font></p>

	<h2><font face="Cursive">Examples of how Leaflet has been used journalistically</font></h1>
	<p><font face="verdana">The map shown in the following link shows where people were shot in Chicago.
	It is broken down by community area. The darker shades of blue indicate greater numbers of victims in the areas.
	The Chicago Tribune Breaking News staff compiled the data. This visualization was done in Leaflet and provides
	an example of how journalists use the tool. This tool was a good fit for the data because The map indicates
	which places are at greater risk for shootings, is easy to read, and has interactive pop-ups with provide
	additional information which can be easily accessed by the user. The markers for the exact places where 
	shootings took place was also helpful.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana">The following map is from August of 2012. It involves an election which made the former Texas Solicitor General
	Ted Cruz the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate and former state representative Paul Sadler the Democrat choice.
	The maps below show how each county voted individually in the primary elections. The pulldown menu can be used
	to choose the Democrat or Republican map. Moving the cursor over a county will show the actual vote counts
	and percentages. There is a legend for reference of the meaning of the colors in the bottom right hand corner
	of the map. This tool was a good fit for this data because the map was zoomed to the state alone, provided very
	detailed pop-ups provide a pleasant and navigable experience for the user. The legend and coloring was also
	useful.</font></p>

     small changes in the coding of the visualization can change the output.</font></p>

	<div>
	<h2><font face="Cursive">Limitations of the tool</font></h1>
	<p><font face="verdana">The maps displayed on Leaflet are based on OpenStreetMap, which is a free editable map of the world. This means the map could be inaccurate considering it can be edited by any Internet user.
	Another limitation of Leaflet is that it is simply a JavaScript library. It is free, but it does not provide maps. One must choose a tile service to combine with it.
	I have also read that many people have had issues with memory leaks using Leaflet.
