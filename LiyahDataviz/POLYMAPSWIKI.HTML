<h2> <style="text-align:center;"By Liyah Owens </h2>

<p>Polymaps is a JavaScript library for generating “slippy” maps in the style of Google Maps, Modest Maps,CloudMade and OpenLayers.
</p>
<p>Most mapping libraries focus on 256 by 256-pixel image tiles, with only limited support for dynamic overlays such as county boundaries and point clouds. These libraries assume that data needed to produce the desired overlay can be loaded into memory all-at-once, making it difficult to visualize large datasets. Furthermore, while image tiles automatically adjust in resolution as the map zooms in or out, the overlay resolution remains constant; this greatly limits multi-scale exploration of data, as the resolution must be fixed either for macro- (e.g., state-level) or micro- (e.g., block-level) </p>
<p> The goal of Polymaps is to better support rich, large-scale data overlays on interactive maps by extending the tile metaphor to vector graphics:  addition to standard image tiles, Polymaps supports vector tiles that are rendered with SVG. The vector geometry is loaded as GeoJSON via asynchronous XMLHttpRequest; Pointgeometry objects are rendered as SVG circle elements, Polygons as paths, and so on. By loading geometry at known tile boundaries, requests can be issued efficiently on-demand by the client, and responses trivially cached on the server. When the user zooms in, geometry can be seamlessly refined to show greater detail, while on zoom out, geometry can be simplified to improve performance.
</p>
<p> • What the tool is and why it is used:
Polymaps provides a speedy display of multi-zoom datasets over maps, it also supports a variety of visual presentations for tiled vector data, in addition to the usual cartography from OpenStreetMap, CloudMade, Bing, and other providers of image-based web maps.
       Polymaps can load data at a full range of scales, it’s ideal for showing information from country level on down to states, cities, neighborhoods, and individual streets. Because Polymaps uses SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) to display information, you can use familiar, comfortable CSS rules to define the design of your data. And because Polymaps uses the well known spherical mercator tile format for its imagery and its data, publishing information is a snap.</p>
<p> • Where to get the tool
 you can get Polymaps from PolyMaps.org. It is a link on the website to download the javascript tool.There is even a github dedicated to the tool in order to better help you use the tool.The github acts as a repository to get premade information to intergrate into your own line of code.
