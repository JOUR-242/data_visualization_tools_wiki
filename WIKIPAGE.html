	<h2 class="H">What the tool is and why it is used.</h2>
		<img src="http://imgur.com/miWfq0Y" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/>
		<p class="P">For this assignment I created an interactive stacked bar chart using Charts.js. This is a website that provides libraries and documentation that allows you to easily create interactive charts.</p>
	<h2 class="H">What is it Thinking?</h3>
		<p class="P">This program reacts completely based on if/then processes. If you click on a pick number, then the overlay displays the pick information. If you click on the toggle switch, then the list changes its order.</p>
	<h2 class="H">Patterns, Trends and Comparisons</h2>
		<p class="P">This interactive does not have a lot of analytical patterns or trends. But it allows you to change the pattern on the screen. You can switch between seeing the draft order, and seeing the picks in order based on how risky they are. You can compare different picks based on which ones are risky and which ones are safe. And within the picks, you can compare the best and worst players at those picks.</p>
	<h2 class="H">Labels, Legends and Keys</h2>
		<p class="P">There are many labels on this program. First, risk meter that shows what colors are safe (green) and what colors are risky (red). Then the numbers to represent the different picks and allows you to look in more detail into the different picks. Within the pick profiles are the <span>Best</span> and <span>Worst</span> players drafted at that pick.</p>
	<h2 class="H">Story Enhancement</h2>
		<p class="P">This interactive enhances the readers experience by allowing you easily move through different picks to discover which ones are more risky than other. It is easy to read, use and understand.</p>
	<h2 class="H">Important Context</h2>
		<p class="P">This interactive shows a variety of different ways to view the best and worst draft picks. Two easy and interesting way to look at the set of data. Plus a little more information about each pick.</p>
	<h2 class="H">Context Not Included</h2>
		<p>The only thing that this interactive doesn't include that I think it should is a list of notable <span>safe</span> picks and notable <span>risky</span> picks.</p>
